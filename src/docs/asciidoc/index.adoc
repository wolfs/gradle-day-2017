== Overview of Gradle

=== Gradle +++<br />+++ (management summary)

* Multi purpose software automation tool
* Build, automate and deliver better software, faster
* Cross-platform
* Language agnostic
* Apache v2 licensed
* A Build Tool + Gradle Enterprise (on premise + cloud)

=== Momentum

* ~30 full time engineers working on Gradle
* 3.0 released on August 15th 2016
* 3.5 released on April 10th 2017
* 4.0 released on June 14th 2017
* 4.1 released on Aug 8th 2017
* Releasing every 4 - 6 weeks.
* 3-5 million downloads per month

=== What is Gradle Enterprise?

Gradle Enterprise is a platform on top of the Gradle build tool that allows to
maximize productivity of developers and build teams, hosted on-premises.

=== The feature sets

== Developer productivity

=== Influences on +++<br />+++ developer productivity

* IDE
* Languages and frameworks
* Good hardware
* Training
* Food in cafeteria

=== Four pillars of +++<br />+++ developer productivity

* Fast feedback cycles
* High degree of automation
* Faster debugging
* Productivity culture

== Fast feedback cycles

* Maximum build performance
* Measure and optimize
* Build reliability

=== Maximum build performance

> *Maximum build performance* is the maximum achievable performance of a build system *for your code base.*

=== Test projects

* Large monolithic: 1 prj, 50000 src
* Small multiproject: 10 prj, 100 src/prj
* Medium multiproject: 100 prj, 100 src/prj
* Large multiproject: 500 prj, 100 src/prj

=== Incremental build
image::incremental-build.png[background,size=70% 70%]

=== Gradle is up to 100 times faster than Maven

=== How

* Compile avoidance
* Incremental compilation

=== Build cache

Gradle is reusing results +
from *last time*  +
when we ran *this build* +
 on *this machine*. +

=== Gradle can do better

=== Why not...

from *anytime before*  +
when we ran *any build* +
 *anywhere*. +

$> gradle --build-cache assemble
Build cache is an incubating feature.
:compileJava FROM-CACHE
:processResources

:assemble

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

=== Build cache - Demo

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Show cached build from CI (pull/push)
* Show cache built-in node UI
* Show cache controller UI
* Look at cache controller UI
--

=== Build cache

* Stable for Java, Groovy and Scala projects
* Gradle Enterprise provides a backend
* Dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/gradle/build-cache-node/[gradle/build-cache-node]

=== Measure and optimize

* Need data
** CI server captures times
** What about developer builds
* Enter build scans

=== What are build scans?

* Persistent record of what happened during a build
* Permanent and shareable URL
* For developers and build engineers

=== Build scans - Demo

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Navigate to summary, open performance tab, open timeline tab, open plugins view
* Show scan list
* Build categorization via Tags
--

=== Measure and optimize

* Need data
** Use the Gradle Enterprise export API

=== Export API

video::202944447[vimeo,height=520]

=== Build reliability

* Reliable parallelism
* Cache is a forcing function
* Build scans for debugging

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Show scan with build failure (link to line)
* Show scan with failing test (link to test failure)
* Search for dependency on dependency view
* Search for builds with requested task `clean`
* Infrastructure comparison
--

=== Build performance and build scans - Demo

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Show input comparison for build cache
* Go into detail of the Performance improvements
** configuration time
** long running tasks
** long running tests
--

== Higher degree of automation

=== Composite build

* Works now with --continuous
* Excellent IDE integration (Eclipse/Intellij)
* Parallel composite build

=== Composite build - roadmap

* Integration with build scans
* Make substitution configureable
* Composite task names

=== Faster debugging

* Build scans!
* Traceability
* Custom values

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Show custom values: CI, VCS information, Checkstyle errors, Links, etc.
--

== Productivity Culture

* Accountability
* Professionalization
* Product vs Support

== Developer experience

=== Guides

image::guides.png[width=60%,height=60%]

=== Kotlin DSL

* Kotlin DSL version 0.10 (Gradle 4.1)
* Statically typed
* Good IDE support
